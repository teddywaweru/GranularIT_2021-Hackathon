## Hackathon

You  are working with a training organization, and they have a requirement, to have an interactive timetable, that shows their courses on offer.

Create a page that has an interactive timetable pulling from the json data file, using javascript

### Minimum Requirement

Pull data from a json file, and show it on the interactive table

### What we would like to see

- Filtering/searching of the data in the table, for e.g filtering by getting courses happening in a date range, i.e. all courses happening in October 2021 - November 2021
- Filtering/search by course name. 
- Filter by times; show all courses happening in a specified time range; ie courses happening between 2pm - 5pm
- Filter by delivery type - if online, show all courses that are online.
- Filter by course price (courses between 5000 KSH and 20000 KSH).
